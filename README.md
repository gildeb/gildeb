Hi, I’m a french physics teacher
 
I’m interested in microcontroller software, especially micropython
 
I’d like to share some of my developments 
 
I've been working on different platforms: Pyboard, Pyboard-D, Nucleo-F411RE, TTGO-Tdisplay (esp32) and recently Raspberry Pi pico (rasp2)

To reach me, send an email to gilles.debouard@wanadoo.fr
